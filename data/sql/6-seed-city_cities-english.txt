-- CITY RELATIONSHIPS - ENGLISH REFERENCE
-- Note: This file contains only city-to-city relationships using IDs
-- No Portuguese text to translate - only city names used in WHERE clause

The city_cities table stores relationships between cities.
City names in the WHERE clause are proper nouns that remain the same:
- Rio de Janeiro
- Tóquio (could be changed to "Tokyo" if desired for consistency)
- Bangkok
- Barcelona
- Nova York (could be changed to "New York" if desired for consistency)
- Krabi
- Bali
- Amsterdã (could be changed to "Amsterdam" if desired for consistency)
- Cancún
- Dubai
- Cidade do México (could be changed to "Mexico City" if desired for consistency)
- Hong Kong
- Košice
- Melbourne
- Singapura (could be changed to "Singapore" if desired for consistency)

OPTIONAL CITY NAME UPDATES (for consistency with English):
UPDATE cities SET name = 'Tokyo' WHERE name = 'Tóquio';
UPDATE cities SET name = 'New York' WHERE name = 'Nova York';
UPDATE cities SET name = 'Amsterdam' WHERE name = 'Amsterdã';
UPDATE cities SET name = 'Mexico City' WHERE name = 'Cidade do México';
UPDATE cities SET name = 'Singapore' WHERE name = 'Singapura';

Note: Changing city names will require updating references in other tables/code.
